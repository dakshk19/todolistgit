Hey there , welcome to my todolist application. i have tried to make a software that can bring some positive impact to your life.
so lets dive into it.

so the application is currently a basic code written in vs code. to access and use it you have to open the todolist in vs code and run it. the readme file currently is based on the amount of work that has been done on the project till now. in future, it will be updated accordingly

when you open the application and run it you will get 3 options -
1. add task
2. show tasks
3. remove task

you have to press the number corresponding to the tasks which you want to perform. lets suppose you want to add a task in the list so press 1 or you want to delete task so press 3.

In add tasks, it will ask you task number and name of the task so one by one input that. after you give in the values, it will give a message "task added" for your confirmation

In show task, you just have to press 2 and it will show all the tasks which you have added

remove task will be available soon. i am working on that

thankyou for visiting
