# TODOLIST

Hey there , Welcome to the Todolist

I have tried to make a software that can bring some
positive impact to your life.
so lets dive into it.
So, currently the application is a basic code written in python integrated with my sql. you can add the tasks you want to 
complete in the day, remove the task which is no longer required, mark task done or pending on basis of current status and see the overall todolist

## Setup 
1. clone the repo from github
  
  ```git clone https://github.com/dakshk19/todolistgit ```

2. open the directory

   ``` cd todolistgit```

3. set up virtual environment

   ```
   python -m venv xyz
   source xyz/bin/activate
   ```
4. install dependency
   
   ``` pip install mysql-connector-python ```

6. run the code
   
   ``` python TodolistUPDATE.py```

## Tech stack
- Language: Python,Mysql
- libraries: 'mysql.connector'

## How to use

When you run the application, you will have 3 options
 
- add tasks
