you have to press the number corresponding to the tasks which you want to perform. lets suppose you want to add a task in the list so press 1 or you want to delete task so press 3.

In add tasks, it will ask you task number and name of the task so one by one input that. after you give in the values, it will give a message "task added" for your confirmation

In show task, you just have to press 2 and it will show all the tasks which you have added

remove task will be available soon. i am working on that

thankyou for visiting
